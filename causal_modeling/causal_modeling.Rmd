# Normal regression estimates associations. But we want *causal* estimates: what would happen if *everyone* in the study were exposed to x vs if *no one* was exposed.

# Marginal Structural Models
1. Fit a model for the *exposure*, ` x ~ z` where z is all covariates
2. Get the predictions for that model, then invert them
3. Use the inverted probabilities as weights in a second model of `y ~ x`

class: inverse
# G-Computation/G-Formula
1. Fit a model for `y ~ x + z` where z is all covariates
2. Create a duplicate of your data set for each level of `x` 
3. Set the value of x to a single value for each cloned data set (e.g `x = 1` for one, `x = 0` for the other)

---

class: inverse
# G-Computation/G-Formula
4. Make predictions using the model on the cloned data sets
5. Get the estimate you want, e.g. `mean(x_1) - mean(x_0)`

class: inverse

# Picking variables for the model
1. Build a DAG
2. Choose a reasonable set of variables that blocks all other associations between x and y that are not causal
