## Flipper length by year and species

```{r}
#| label: include-figure
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("lter_penguins.png")
```

This dataset includes information on `r n_distinct(penguins$species)` species across `r n_distinct(penguins$year)` years.

```{r}
#| label: fig-flippers
#| fig-cap: "Flipper length by year and species"
#| echo: false
#| message: false
penguins |> 
  group_by(species, year) |> 
  summarize(
    mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
    .groups = "drop"
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(factor(year), mean_flipper_length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ species)
```

Flipper length is greatest among Gentoo penguins. As penguins aged, their flippers got longer. See @fig-flippers for more information.
