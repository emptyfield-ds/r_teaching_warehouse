# R Markdown Tables

From Malcolm:

> Repo location: https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/r_teaching_warehouse/tree/master/rmarkdown_tables

> * You won't have to do a lot of setting up the problem here, as people will have seen a bit on Rmd at this point and appreciate the reproducibility.

> * The exercises first explore markdown tables then `kable()`, but the main focus should be gtsummary

> * I think it would be good to include a slide near the end about gt, maybe with the hex sticker, so I can point people to that

> * I included the diabetes dataset, which I think will be good for slide examples. See the R Markdown whole game folder for a work up of this dataset that uses a couple of `gtsummary` tables
